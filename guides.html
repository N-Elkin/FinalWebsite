            <p><strong>What is Malware?<br></strong> Ransomware is a type of malware that prevents or limits users
              from accessing their system, either by locking the system's screen or by locking the users' files
              until
              a ransom is paid. More modern ransomware families, collectively categorized as crypto ransomware,
              encrypt certain file types on infected systems and force users to pay the ransom through certain
              online
              payment methods to get a decryption key. Ransomware is considered "scareware" as it forces users to
              pay
              a fee (or ransom) by scaring or intimidating them. Once executed in the system, ransomware can
              either lock
              the computer screen or encrypt predetermined files. In the first scenario, a full-screen image or
              notification
              is displayed on an infected system's screen, which prevents a victim from using their system. This
              notification
              also details instructions on how a user can pay the ransom. In the second scenario, ransomware
              prevents
              access to potentially critical or valuable files like documents and spreadsheets. </p>

            <strong>Malware Protection</strong>
            <p> Ransomware can be downloaded onto systems when unwitting users visit malicious
              or compromised websites. It can also arrive as a payload that is either dropped or downloaded by other
              malware. Some ransomware is delivered
              as attachments from spammed email, downloaded from malicious pages through malicious advertisements, or
              dropped by exploit kits onto
              vulnerable systems. Some ways to protect yourself from ransomware are:

                Immediately disconnect the device from the network (Wi-Fi or ethernet) or power down the machine if this

                to your other devices.

                Wipe the device and reinstall the operating system – In the event that your anti-malware software could
                not completely remove the malware, if you have backed up your important files, wiping the device is the
                most reliable way to ensure that your device is no longer infected. You will need to reinstall the

            <p><strong>According to the FBI, </strong> phishing emails are the most popular attack method used by
              hackers to deliver ransomware to individuals and organizations. Phishing attacks or Phishing scams are
              fraudulent emails, text messages, phone calls or web sites designed to trick users into downloading
              malware, sharing sensitive information or personal data (e.g., Social Security and credit card numbers,
              bank account numbers, login credentials), or taking other actions that expose themselves or their
              organizations to cybercrime. Successful phishing attacks often lead to identity theft, credit card fraud,
              ransomware attacks, data breaches, and huge financial losses for individuals and corporations. </p>

                advertisers, they can also contain malicious or unsafe code. A pop-up blocker can prevent some or all
                these windows from appearing. Many pop-up windows are a product of spyware so if they appear, close them
                immediately using the x in the title bar. </button>
              <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">Always think twice before downloading

                features like toolbars or other software for free. Make sure that what you’re downloading comes from a
                site that you trust. This is especially true for mobile devices. Make sure that the apps you download
                are from verified vendors on the app store. </button>

              crypto mining is an online threat that hides on a computer or mobile device and uses the machine’s
              resources to “mine” forms of online currency known as cryptocurrencies. This type of software is designed
              to stay completely hidden from the user and use their victim’s device’s resources which can slow down
              other processes, increase your electricity bills, and shorten the life of your device. </p><br>

            Crypto jacking has more than one way to infiltrate your computer. One way works like classic malware where
            you click on a malicious link or download, and it loads the crypto jacking software directly onto your
            computer. Another way is called drive-by crypto mining where a malicious piece of code is embedded into a
            webpage and automatically starts running when a user visits that page.

                <strong>Here are some ways to protect yourself from crypto jacking: </strong>
              </button>
              <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">Monitor your system’s usage – The
                main way that crypto jacking software works is to use your computer’s resources to mine cryptocurrency.
                Regularly check the resource usage to check for any anomalies that would indicate crypto jacking
                software using your resources. </button>
              <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">Install antivirus software–
                Installing antivirus software from a trusted provider app and keeping it up to date can help your PC
                detect and defend against crypto jacking software and other types of malwares.</button>
              <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">Use browser extensions designed to
                prevent crypto jacking - Use browser extensions like Miner Block or No Coin to block cryptocurrency
                mining scripts from running in your browser. </button>
              <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">Keep software up to date – Out of
                date software has vulnerabilities that can be used by hackers to compromise it and run crypto jacking
                software. </button>
              <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">Always think twice about what you
                download – Just like any other malware, downloading software or files that you aren't familiar with
                could expose your device to crypto jacking software and other malware. </button>
              <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">Limit your access to cryptocurrency
                websites – Many cryptocurrency websites are a target for drive by crypto ackers so limiting your
                exposure to these websites can reduce the risk of your computer being infected. </button>
              <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">Disable JavaScript on your browser –
                Drive by crypto jacking works by automatically running a JavaScript code when you visit a website.
                However, this may also interrupt website functionality that you may want. </button>
